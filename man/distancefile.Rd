\title{Get a Distance table that can be used as a connector file in Conefor}
\usage{
distancefile(nodes, id, type = "centroid", distance_unit = NULL,
  tolerance = NULL, resistance = NULL, mask = NULL,
  threshold = NULL, geometry_out = NULL, multiple = NULL,
  prefix = NULL, write = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{object of class sf, sfc, sfg or SpatialPolygons. The shapefile must be in a projected coordinate system.}

\item{id}{character. Column name with the node ID in the shapefile data table.}

\item{type}{character. Choose one of the distances: "centroid" (faster, default), where euclidean distance is calculated from feature centroid; "edge", where euclidean distance is calculated from feature edges;
"hausdorff-edge", where hausdorff distance is calculated from feature edges;
"least-cost" that takes into account obstacles and local friction of the landscape (See, gdistance package);
"commute-time" that is analogous to the resistance distance of circuitscape. The commute-time distance is based on the random walk theory and calculated using the electrical circuit theory (See, gdistance package).
If the type is equal to "least-cost" or "commute-time", then you have to use the resistance argument.}

\item{distance_unit}{character. If euclidean distance is selected you can set a distance unit, udunits2 package compatible unit (e.g., "km", "cm", "ft", "inch"). Default equal to meters "m".}

\item{tolerance}{numeric. Argument for higher processing speed. In case you have selected the "edge" or "hausdorff-edge" distance, use this option to simplify the geometry and reduce the number of vertices (see, rgeos::gSimplify()).}

\item{resistance}{raster. Raster object with resistance values (landscape friction).}

\item{mask}{object of class sf, sfc, sfg or SpatialPolygons. For higher processing speed of "least-cost" or "commute-time" distances.
Use this option to clip the resistance at the extent of the mask.}

\item{threshold}{numeric. Distance threshold, pairs of nodes with a distance value above this threshold will be discarded.}

\item{geometry_out}{numeric. Use this argument in case you have selected the "least-cost" or "commute-time".
If some spatial geometries are out of the resistance extent, then a buffer zone the large enough to cover these spatial geometries and with this numeric value will be added to the resistance, so that it is possib√±e to calculate a cost distance value for the pairs of nodes that involve these geometries.
If NULL, then a Euclidean distance (centroid) will be calculated to find these distances.}

\item{multiple}{character. Column name of the column with the zone to which each core area belongs.}

\item{prefix}{character. Initial prefix, use in case of processing several sites at the same time in CONEFOR command line.}

\item{write}{character. Choose the output folder if you use name_zona otherwise, place the output path, with the name and extension ".txt".}
